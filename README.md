# BOT-SHACL-Generator
Generate full SHACL constraints from SHACL snippets for Building Topology Ontology

Running the "Codegenerator.py" asks for user input on selection of bot classes and properties for which SHACL shape constraints have to be generated. 

After user input, a new final file "finalSHACLShape.ttl" is created which contains all relevant shapes against which a data graph can be validated.
